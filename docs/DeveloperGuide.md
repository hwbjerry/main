## Setting up

### Prerequisite

```
1.JDK ​ 11 ​ or above
2.IntelliJ IDE
```
### Setting up

1. Fork ​this repo​, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click ​File​ > ​Close
    Project​ to close the existing project dialog first)
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
    a. Click ​Configure​ > ​Project Defaults​ > ​Project Structure
    b. Click ​New...​ and find the directory of the JDK
4. Click ​Import Project
5. Locate the ​build.gradle​ file and select it. Click ​OK​.
6. Click ​Open as Project​.
7. Click ​OK​ to accept the default settings.
8. Open a console and run the command ​gradlew processResources
    (Max/Linux: ​./gradlew processResources​). It should finish with
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL​ message.
    This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

### 1.3 Verifying the setup

1. Run the ​Launcher​ and try a few commands
2. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.

### 1.4 Configurations to do before writing code

```
1.4.1 Configuring the coding style
This project follows oss-generic coding standards. IntelliJ’s default style is mostly
compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,
```

    1. Go to ​File​ >​ Settings...​ (Windows/Linux), or ​IntelliJ IDEA​ >
        Preferences...​ (macOS)
    2. Select ​Editor​ > ​Code Style​ > ​Java
    3. Click on the Imports tab to set the order
        a. For ​Class count to use import with '*'​ and ​Names
           count to use static import with '*':​ Set to ​ 999 ​ to
           prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
        b. For ​Import Layout​: The order is ​import static all other
           imports​, ​import java.*​, ​import javafx.*​, ​import
           org.*, import com.*​, ​import all other imports​. Add a
           <blank line>​ between each ​import​.
    Optionally, you can follow the UsingCheckstyle.adoc document to configure
    Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.
 ```
 1.4.2 Updating documentation to match your fork
 ```
    After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the
    AY1920S1-CS2113T-W12-4/main repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate
    product (i.e. instead of contributing to the AY1920S1-CS2113T-W12-4/main) ,
    you should replace the URL in the variable ​repoURL​ in DeveloperGuide.pdf and
    UserGuide.pdf with the URL of your fork.
```
1.4.3 Getting started with coding
```
    When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of
    the overall design by reading about BetterDuke’s architecture.


## 2. Design

### 2.1 Architecture

```
Figure 1.The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level
design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.
Main has 2 classes called Main and MainWindow. It is responsible for:
● At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence,
and connects them up with each other.
● At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes saving to
txt where necessary.
Commons​ represents a collection of classes used by multiple other
components. The following class plays an important role at the
architecture level:
```

● LookupTable​ : Used by many classes to convert academic dates
to standard date time format and vice versa.  
The app consists of five ​components​:  
● Logic : The command executor  
● Model : Modifies and stores data of App in-memory  
● Storage : Read data from and write data to files  
● UI: The UI of the App  
● dukeexceptions: Custom Duke exceptions that may be raised from contextual errors 
 while executing commands in BetterDuke.  
For example, the ​Parser​ component (see the class diagram given below)  
defines it’s API in the ​MainParser.java​ interface and exposes its functionality 
using the ​Duke.java​ class.  
Figure 2. Class Diagram of Logic Component  
_Event- Driven design_  


**How the architecture components interact with each other**
Figure 3: The ​ _Sequence Diagram_ ​ below shows how the components interact with  
each other for the scenario where the user issues the command ​Add/e A​.  


### 2.2 Duke component

    The ​UI​ consists of​ Main​, ​MainWindow​ and ​AlertBox​. ​MainWindow​ makes use of ​DeadlineView​, 
    ​DukeResponseView​ and ​ProgressController which handles all displays and interactions with users.
    The ​UI​ component uses ​JavaFx​ ​UI​ framework. The layout of these ​UI​ parts are defined in 
    matching ​.fxml​ files that are in the ​src/main/resources/view folder.
    For example, the layout of ​MainWindow​ is specified in Mainwindow.fxml​.
    The UI component,  
    ● Executes user commands using the Logic component.  
    ● Listens for changes to Model data so that the UI can be updated with the
    modified data.  


### 2.3 parser component

Figure 4. Structure of the Logic Component
The ​Logic​ component handles the parsing of user input and interacts with the
Command objects.

1. Logic​ uses the ​MainParser​ class to parse user command.
2. This results in a ​Command​ object which is executed by ​Duke​.
3. The command execution can affect the ​Model​ (e.g. adding a event).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a ​CommandResult
    object which is passed back to the ​UI.
5. In addition, the ​CommandResult​ object can also instruct the ​Ui​ to perform
    certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.


### 2.4 Storage component

    Figure 5: Class Diagram for Model component
    _Classes involved: Storage_
    The Storage class ensures data persistence upon termination of BetterDuke and is the
    intermediary between the external files and the Model component.
    
   #### **2.4.1. External files**
    Data in BetterDuke is saved and loaded from two main text (.txt) files.
    ● deadline..txt: Contains the current list of deadlines
    ● event.txt: Contains the current list of events
   #### **2.4.2. Storage attributes and methods (Loading and Saving)**
    Loading and saving to/from the above mentioned external files are vital for Storage to
    function. In order to do both, Storage has attributes of File type which records the paths
    to the local external files. There is also a temporary hashmap created to retrieve and
    store data from the Model component.


For loading from files, we need to read and write both external files mentioned above,
so dedicated methods for deadline.txt and event.txt are present

### 2.5 UI component


## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 [Proposed] Filter by Keyword feature


#### 3.1.1 How the feature is implemented.
    The filter mechanism is facilitated by FilterCommand, which extends the Command
    Abstract class.
    The format of the command is as follows: filter “keyword”
    Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user enters a filter command.

    1. The user enters a filter command using the following command line input
        filter keyword​. After command has been parsed, FilterCommand is created.
    2. FilterCommand#execute() then operates 2 For loops for both events list and
        deadline list.
    3. The tasks are converted to string form using Tasklist#toString() method to
        facilitate easy searching.
    4. The keyword is then match to the events and deadlines using Java function
        .contain().
    5. A String message is then returned back by calling Ui#showFilter() from
        FilterCommand for display by JavaFx graphic user interface.
    6. If the keyword is not found in any of the task, an alertbox will be returned
        indicating a mismatched keyword.
    * This function matches both uppercase and lowercase matches of the keyword to the
    task in string format.
    
 #### 3.1.2 Why it is implemented that way.
    It is implemented this way to allow user to enter a short command for easy usability. The
    user may enter the keyword in both uppercase and lowercase and both uppercase and
    lowercase instances of the keyword would be returned. ​As long as the keyword or
    phrase is a sub-string in the description field, the task is returned as a match.


The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a
command:

#### 3.1.3 How the feature works
Step 1: Input Command in the Command textbox and press submit
Step 2:System will display response with keyword “cs2113” in the response box

##### 3.1.4 Design Considerations

| Aspect                                             | Alternative 1 (Current Choice)                                                                                                                                                                      | Alternative 2                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1)Function to use for search function              | Search using Java contains to match substring of task   Pros: Efficient, results can be retrieved in O (1) time   Cons: May return inconsequential results (filter 1 may return cs2101, 123, task1) | Search using Java regex to match specific word   Pros: Results returned are more specific, only words are returned   Cons: Inefficient, especially if there are many tasks, O(n) time |
| 2)Data structure to support the undo/redo commands | Search by arrayList   Pros: Easy to implement   Cons: Inefficient, especially if there are many tasks, O(n) time                                                                                    | Search by HashMap   Pros: Efficient, results can be retrieved in O(1) time   Cons: Searching by Key may not return all instances of keyword   Difficult and tedious to map by keyword |

  #### 3.1.5 Future Optimisations/ Version 2.
    ● Implementing filter feature using multiple keywords
    ```
    - Allows users to enter multiple keywords so as to better specific tasks that
        the user wants.
    ● Suggested list of keyword prompts
    - Shows a list of keywords common in all existing tasks allowing users to
    select keyword more easily

### 3.2 Remind feature

```
3.2.1 Implementation
The remind feature mechanism is facilitated by RemindCommand and Reminder.
RemindCommand extends Command with an abstract execution method specific for the
remind feature. It then calls on Reminder which implements the following core
operations:
● Reminder#setReminderThread() - Runs a new thread using Timer and
TimerTask for a reminder pop-up at set timing by user.
● Reminder#removeTimerTask() - Removes an existing reminder thread that was
created previously.
These operations are exposed in RemindCommand as RemindCommand#execute().
```

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when a user sets a reminder
explained.

1. The user calls on remind command using the following command line input.
    remind/set...​ to set a new reminder. After command has been parsed,
    RemindCommand is created.
2. RemindCommand#execute() then retrieves Reminder object from the storage
    using Storage#getReminderObject() to enable methods in Reminder for
    RemindCommand.
3. Multiple checks are further conducted in RemindCommand#execute() to ensure a
    valid remind command input before calling Reminder#setReminderThread().
4. Reminder#setReminderThread() then makes use of Timer and TimerTask for
    future execution in the JavaFx main thread.
5. A String message is then returned back by calling Ui#showReminder() from
    RemindCommand for display by JavaFx graphic user interface.
Removal of a reminder is exactly the same as setting a reminder, with the exception of
the step 4 and 5. In step 4, Reminder#removeTimerTask is called instead and thread is
removed as timer is cancelled in this method. In step 5, Ui#showCancelReminder is
called by RemindCommand instead.
Below is an activity diagram which shows what happens when a user types the remind
command:



Below is a sequence diagram which shows how set reminder operation works:
3.2.2 Additional implementation outside of RemindCommand
In an effort to retain reminders set by users after software’s process is terminated,
remind feature is additionally facilitated by Storage and Reminder to set reminders
automatically based on the save data. However, only the following core operation is
implemented:
● Reminder#setReminderThread() - Runs a new thread using Timer and
TimerTask for a reminder pop-up at set timing by user.
This operation is exposed in Storage as Storage#setReminderOnStart().
Sequence is similar to the main implementation of setting reminder when it reaches
Reminder#setReminderThread(). However, initial steps are as follows:

1. The user launches the application. Storage and Reminder objects are created in
    Duke.


2. Reminder object is passed to storage by calling the method
    Storage#setReminderObject() in Duke to enable methods in Reminder for
    Storage.
3. Duke then calls method Storage#setReminderOnStart() to execute
    Reminder#setReminderThread() based on the save data read in Storage.
This operation only happens when there are reminders set by user after application
process is terminated.
3.2.3 Reasons for current implementations
3.2.3.1 Threading
Threading is used because of the nature of setting a reminder. As a result, Timer class
and TimerTask class from Java utilities package is used to facilitate scheduling of
reminder tasks for future execution in JavaFx main thread.
3.2.3.2 Reminder class
Main reason for a separate class from RemindCommand for main implementation is
because the lifeline of Reminder needs to be as long as Duke. This cannot happen with
RemindCommand as the lifeline of RemindCommand gets destroyed when it returns a
String message. As a result of this, all thread and reminder data can be stored
indefinitely so that removal/setting of thread and reminder can happen anytime
throughout the lifetime of the application.
Additionally, this facilitates the additional implementation mentioned above, allowing for
threading to happen automatically when the application is launched.
3.2.4 Known issues
3.2.4.1 ControlsFX notifications without stage
Current reminder pop-up implementation uses AlertBox class that was manually coded
and Notifications by ControlsFX. When application is hidden in system tray,
NullPointerException is thrown because stage is not shown. As a result, an empty
transparent window is created to be used as the stage to bypass this issue for the
notification to pop-up. This window has to either be closed manually or closed by clicking
on notification pop-up. ​This is a known issue that ControlsFX closed without fixing.
3.2.4.2 Save data limitation


Issue only happens when multiple reminders are set for the same task. If application is
terminated before reminder pops up, only the latest time for which a reminder was set for
that particular task would be added to a new thread when application is re-launched. All
old reminder timings for that particular task would be gone.

### 3.3 Find Free Time feature

3.3.1 Implementation
The find free times feature mechanism is facilitated by ​FindFreeTimes​ command
and ​RetrieveFreeTimes​ command. The command ​FindFreeTimes​ which
extends ​Command​ class with an abstract execution method specific to
FindFreeTimesCommand​. It then calls on ​RetrieveFreeTimes​Command​ if the
user decides to use one of the 5 suggested options.
● FindFreeTimesCommand#mapDataMap()​ - Maps the list of events that is
after the current date and time into dataMap
● FindFreeTimesCommand#findFindTime()​- Finds the best time available
with the list of events in dataMap into freeTimeData
● FindFreeTimesCommand#setOutput()​ - ​Generates the output to be shown
using data in the freeTimeData
These operations are exposed in FindFreeTimesCommand as
FindFreeTimesCommand#execute().
Below is the implementation when ​FindFreeTimesCommand​ is called.
Step 1: The user launches the application, BetterDuke and enters an input ​find ‘x’
hours​, where ‘x’ is a digit between 1 -16.
Step 2: BetterDuke will display the 5 best time available based on the duration, ‘x’ and
the list of event in the storage, entered by the user through an alert box.
Step 3: If the user choose not to use any of the free times displayed to him, skip this step
and step 4. Otherwise, user can choose to either the first option, the second option, the
third option, the fourth option, or the five option by entering ​retrieve/ft 1​,
retrieve/ft 2​, ​retrieve/ft 3​, ​retrieve/ft 4​ or ​retrieve/ft 5​ ​in
the command line respectively​.
Step 4: The application will automatically enter the input choice chosen by the user into
the command line and run the program again using this input.


The following Activity diagram shows find free time feature operation flow.


The following sequence diagram is how the ​FindFreeTimes​ command operation
works.


3.3.2 Additional implementation outside of ​FindFreeTimesCommand​.
If the user were to choose to either get the previous first or second, third, fourth or fifth
option from the list displayed to them, the following operation will be implemented:
● RetrieveFreeTimesCommand#getSelectedOption()​ ​- Sets the text in
command line with the option selected.
3.3.3 Reasons for current implementation
The user will not need to browse through the list of events to look for available time. As
the algorithm will find the best hour in the available period this will provide a smooth
usage for the user to manage his/her time.
3.3.4 Design Considerations
Aspect: Display of the free time slots to the user
Alternative 1: AlertBox
Pros: Easy orientation of the details as AlertBox is resizable. By example, ‘option 1:’ new
line ‘option 2:’ and etc.
Cons: AlertBox data is static user may forget options offered and unable to retrieve data
findFreeTimeCommand to be rerun
Alternative 2: TableView
Pros: The data is storage and populated in the TableView allows user to revisit data
Cons: The data shown have to be wrapped to the TableColumn size results in formatting
issues

### 3.4 Retrieve Free Time Feature

3.4.1 Implementation
The command ​RetrieveFreeTimes​ which extends ​Command​ class with an abstract
execution method specific to ​RetrieveFreeTimesCommand​. It then calls on
FindFreeTimes​Command​ to retrieve the 5 suggested option.
● FindFreeTimesCommand#getCompiledFreeTimesList() ​- Retrieve the
list of options generated by findFreeTimesComman​d
● RetrieveFreeTimesCommand#checkIsEmpty()​ - Checks if the user
requested for find time with findFreeTimesCommand before entering this
command.


● FindFreeTimesCommand#checkInvalidOption()​- Checks if the user
entered a valid option.
● FindFreeTimesCommand#setOutput()​ - ​Generates the output to be shown
using data in the freeTimeData
These operations are exposed in RetrieveFreeTimesCommand as
RetrieveFreeTimesCommand#execute().
Below is the implementation when ​RetrieveFreeTimesCommand​ is called.
Step 1: The user launches the application, BetterDuke and enters an input ​find ‘x’
hours​, where ‘x’ is a digit between 1 -5.
Step 2: BetterDuke will display the 5 best time available based on the duration, ‘x’ and
the list of event in the storage, entered by the user through an alert box.
Step 3: If the user choose not to use any of the free times displayed to him, skip this step
and step 4. Otherwise, user can choose to either the first option, the second option, the
third option, the fourth option, or the five option by entering ​retrieve/ft 1​,
retrieve/ft 2​, ​retrieve/ft 3​, ​retrieve/ft 4​ or ​retrieve/ft 5​ ​in
the command line respectively​.
Step 4: The application will automatically enter the input choice chosen by the user into
the command line and run the program again using this input.


The following sequence diagram is how the ​RetrieveFreeTimes​ command
operation works.


3.4.3 Reasons for current implementation
The user will be able to view the options provided through the response box. This will
allow the user to better view the data instead of an AlertBox where the data is static. The
ability to select previous free time found through options will reduce the possibility where
human error generates incorrect input.
3.4.4 Design Considerations
Aspect: Display of the selected free time slots to the user through a Response Box and
self populated
Pros: Allows ensures double validation from the user. Example, Command Box and
Response Box this ensures confirmation and prevents wrong entry from human error
Cons: The user may accidentally edit the data provided in the Command Box

### 3.5 Show Previous Feature

3.5.1 Implementation
The Show Previous feature mechanism is facilitated by ​ShowPreviousCommand.
The ​ShowPreviousCommand​ extends ​Command​ class with an abstract execution
method specific to ​ShowPreviousCommand​.
● ShowPreviousCommand#previousCommandsHandler()​ - Adds the
required inputs that the user require to see into the ​outputList​.
● ShowPreviousCommand#getOutputList()​ ​- Generates the
previousCommandsList​.
Below is the implementation when ​ShowPreviousCommand​ is called.
Step 1: The user launches the application, BetterDuke and enters an input
show/previous 3​.
Step 2: BetterDuke will display the previous three inputs entered by the user in the
response box.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new
command:
The following sequence diagram is how the​ ​ShowPreviousCommand​ operation works when
the user enters ​show/previous​ ​in the command line.


3.5.2 Reasons for current implementation
This implementation is useful as it brings more convenience for the user, especially
when there is an error in the formatting of the commands which causes exceptions. This
implementation allows user to see the previous commands entered so that they can
decide whether they want to re-type those commands in the command line.
3.5.3 Design Considerations
Aspect: How show previous commands when executes
● Alternative 1 (current choice): Shows previous commands in a response box,
allocated space in the GUI
○ Pros: User can easily refer to that response box to see the information
presented to them. They will not have to remember the information and
have fear of forgetting them.
○ Cons: It may be a little messy if all the information provided by the
application are presented in that box.
● Alternative 2: Show previous commands in a pop up alert box
○ Pros: Easy to implement. Small and concise way to display information to
the user
○ Cons: User may forget what the previous three commands are after
closing the pop-up alert box.
Aspect: Data structure to support show previous commands
● Alternative 1 (current choice) :Use of array list to store all the user inputs
○ Pros: Easy to implement as there are frequent additions into the list.
Additionally, ​array list is a variable length Collection class.
○ Cons: Significant memory is needed if there are many user inputs.

### 3.6 Retrieve Previous Feature

3.6.1 Implementation
The Retrieve Previous feature mechanism is facilitated by
RetrievePreviousCommand​. ​The ​RetrievePreviousCommand​ extends
Command​ class with an abstract execution method specific to
RetrievePreviousCommand​ if the user decides to use one of the previous inputs.


● RetrievePreviousCommand#getChoosenOutput()​ ​- Generates the
retrievedOutput​.
Below is the implementation when ​RetrievePreviousCommand​ is called.
Step 1: The user launches the application, BetterDuke and enters an input
retrieve/previous 3​.
Step 2: BetterDuke will display the previous input with index 3 from the
getOutputList()​ ​method of ​ShowPreviousCommand​ in the response box.
Step 3: The application will automatically enter the input choice chosen by the user into
the command line which is returned by ​getChosenOutput()​.
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new
command:


The following sequence diagram is how the​ ​RetrievePreviousThreeCommand
operation works when the user enters ​retrieve/previous 3​ ​in the command
line​.
3.6.2 Reasons for current implementation
This implementation is beneficial as it brings more convenience to the user. The user will
not have to re-enter a lengthy command if he/she previously entered the command in the
wrong format. By using this feature, the user can just retrieve the previous command and
edit the incorrect command in the command line box.
3.6.3 Design Considerations
Aspect: Display of the previous command requested to the user
● Alternative 1 (current choice): Display of the requested previous command through a
response box


```
Pros: Allows reference for the user so that they would not type the wrong formatted
command the next time.
Cons: The response box may be filled with responses by BetterDuke and the user may
get confused.
```
### 3.7. Show recommended workload feature

**3.7.1 Implementation**
The show recommended workload feature provides a recommended schedule based on user’s
current already inputted tasks which includes events and deadlines. The feature is facilitated by
showWorkloadCommand ​which extends the Command abstract class.
Format of the command: ​/show workload
Given below shows how the show workload mechanism behaves.
Step 1: User types command ​/show workload ​and ​showWorkloadCommand ​will first obtain the
current academic week from the date the user executes the command, and extract events that
are already inputted in the immediate coming week and insert into a hash map named
workloadMap​.
Step 2: ​showWorkloadCommand ​will now extract deadlines that are within the immediate coming
week (except Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) and early following week and insert into
workloadMap.


Step 3: Betterduke shows the recommended workload schedule for the immediate coming week


The following sequence diagram shows how the show workload operation works:


The following activity diagram summaries what happens when user executes command:
**3.7.2 Design Considerations**
Aspect: How show recommended workload executes
· Alternative 1 (current choice): Shows recommended workload in a pop-up alert box.
o​ ​Pros: Easy to implement, small and concise way to present schedule to user.
o​ ​Cons: User may forget recommended schedule after seeing it.
· Alternative 2: Betterduke keeps all recommended schedules and display it to the user
alongside normal schedule.
o​ ​Pros: User can better toggle between normal and recommended schedules
should he or she wish to.


o​ ​Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
Aspect: Data structure to support show recommended workload commands
· Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a hash map to store all tasks in the workload week.
o​ ​Pros: Easy to store tasks based on common date as the key.
o​ ​Cons: Hash map is not thread-safe and there is potential of collision.
· Alternative 2: Use list to store all tasks in the workload week.
o​ ​Pros: Easy to implement, able to add or remove tasks at a particular position.
o​ ​Cons: Significant memory is required for a large list.
**3.7.3 Future optimisation considered**
· Show recommended workload feature only supports for the immediate coming week
currently.
o​ ​Optimisation: Provide support for any academic week the user inputs.
· Deadline tasks are added into recommended schedule with a fixed algorithm of 3 days
before the due date.
o​ ​Optimisation: Slot the deadline tasks into more empty days.


## Appendix A: Product Scope

### Target user profile

```
Our target users are NUS students with poor time management. An average
NUS student has about 4 to 6 modules each semester, with different workload
required for each module. Since the modules taken each semester are different,
they may have difficulty managing their tasks for each separate module.
Furthermore, NUS students are more often than not always on the move in
University travelling from one faculty to another for their lessons, this is why we
utilise the convenience of their laptop to give them a solution to manage their
never-ending tasks.
```
### Value proposition

```
Given that our target users are NUS students, schedules are hectic with
assignments, lessons and even co-curricular activities. This product would sort all
these activities out and aid in their planning so that they are able to better
manage their time. Additionally, tertiary students need their laptop for school
